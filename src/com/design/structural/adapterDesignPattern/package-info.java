/*
*  it's a great pattern for connecting new code to legacy code without having to change the working contract that was produced from the legacy code originally.
*  Real example is plug adapter but it doesn't cover all it's features
*  choose when we want a client to talk to an existing interface.This is usually the case when on portion of system is a legacy app or module that either we can't do or possibly change.
*  It effectively is translating requests from the client ,the code that we adapting to ,basically a clint to talking to a legacy app or an adaptee that we have used an adapter to talk to.
*  Ex. Collection API in Java, Stram classes surrounding I/O
*  Arrays->Lists
*
*  Design Consideration
